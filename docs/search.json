As an example: \\[ (\\forall x \\in \\mathbb{R})[f_X(x) \\geq 0] \\] is read “for every real number \\(x\\), the value of \\(f_X(x)\\) will be nonnegative”.\nThe symbol \\(\\exists\\) is called the existential quantifier, and is essentially a mathematical way of writing “there exists” or “for at least one”. As an example: \\[ (\\exists x \\in \\mathbb{R})[x^2 = 2] \\] is read “there exists a real number \\(x\\) whose square is 2”.\nI often use the symbol \\(:=\\) to mean “definitionally equal to”. For example, given a random variable \\(Y\\), I’ll often write \\(U := Y^2\\) to mean “let \\(U\\) be another random variable that is, by definition, equal to the square of \\(Y\\).”\nI often use the symbol \\(\\stackrel{!}{=}\\) to mean “set equal to”. For example, solving \\(f'(x) \\stackrel{!}{=} 0\\) for \\(x\\) gives us the set of critical values for the function \\(f(\\cdot)\\)."

By the end of this course, you should be able to:\n\nUnderstand key theorems and results (e.g. law of iterated expectations, central limit theorem, weak and strong laws of large numbers) and how they factor in to the broader statistical framework\nApply common estimation techniques to simulated and real data, and accurately interpret/assess the results (using concepts like bias, consistency, etc.)\nThink critically about the assumptions needed to implement various statistical procedures (and to question results when such assumptions are violated)\nAccurately express your beliefs and conclusions about problems and concepts in a mathematically and statistically rigorous manner"

    "section": "Some General Tips for Success",
    "text": "Some General Tips for Success\nForm study groups\nStatistics is not meant to be a lonely field! There is much we can learn from one another, and it can be an incredibly enlightening experience to discuss problems and ideas with one another. (Just make sure you don’t violate any of the Academic Integrity points listed above)\nBe mindful of how you’re solving problems\nIt’s tempting to start a problem, get about halfway through, and then default to looking at the solutions or a similar worked-out example. This is not an effective way to learn! Rather, start by working through them fully and without looking at similar worked-out problems or solutions. Then you can compare your answers, and identify any areas for potential further study. Finally, return to the problem after a few days and see if you still get stuck in the same places as you did the first time.\nStart things early!\nMake sure you’re giving yourself enough time to complete the homework assignments, study for quizzes/exams, and process the course material. I’d recommend creating a weekly schedule for yourself, and allocating time each day for PSTAT 120B material (whether that be working through the homework, studying for a quiz, or just reading lecture slides/the textbook).\nAttend office hours (TA and Instructor) regularly\nEven if you don’t have a specific question, you’re always more than welcome to sit in on Office Hours and listen to other people’s questions. (Sometimes, doing so will help you formulate your own questions!)\nAttend lectures and Discussion Sections.\nIt’s true that we do not have an attendance policy, but please don’t let yourselves skimp on attendance. Studies show that regular exposure is the best way to learn material, and there really is no substitute for going to Section and Lecture. Also, while you’re in Lecture, take your own notes! Even the act of writing things down and having to synthesize what you think is important information can help you process and learn the material in real time.\nDon’t be too hard on yourself!\nThough a little stress can be a good motivating factor for some, please don’t stress yourself out too much. Your performance in this course is not an evaluation of who you are as a person!"
